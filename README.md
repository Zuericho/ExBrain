# ExBrain front-end app for task and project management

In this repository I keep the files for my front-end app, generically dubbed **ExBrain**. This app will be a project and list management app conforming to the renowned [GTD methodology](https://gettingthingsdone.com) by David Allen.

At the first stage **ExBrain** will be a version of the program sketched by Allen in 1994 - though calendar and ticler files are not included until later stages.
